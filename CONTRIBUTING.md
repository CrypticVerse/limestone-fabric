# Contributing to the mod!

To contribute, we need different language files. You can create a fork of the project and then make a pull request into the main branch.
You will be added to the contributors .json file as long as your fork adds your nane to the fabric mod json file.

I am new to coding and GitHub, so if you have ideas, discuss them in the dicussions tab!
